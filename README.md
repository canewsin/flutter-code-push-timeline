#   Flutter Codepush Timeline
Progress Report for Flutter Code Push Implementation.

This Repo will give progress for implementing Codepush into the Flutter Project.

One thing you should clear about this project is, if it is a success and ready to be usable, code is not going to be open sourced, i will license the keys to individual based on their repo size or project value, implied to minimum license fee. This repo just tracks the progress of implementation Thus no code is uploaded to this repo.

## Issue usage of the repo :
Open an issue for any query related to this project.

After completion of this project, i will open another repo for tracking bugs for the project.

[Update](https://github.com/canewsin/flutter-code-push-timeline/issues/1) :
Hi guys, some people pointed some interest in code push and i want to know how you was in need for code push for flutter. what i want to you to do is if code push is final product how do you want to use it, i was asking because i want to optimize the functionality of code push, so that initialization work can be done with out lags. Open an issue for each unique requirement, see other issues whether your requirement is covered or not. donot open duplicate issues.


## Progress :

    Did anybody tried tinker-lib with flutter which is from tencent github repo and any success with that if anybody interested 
    i can collaborate with you.i tried it able to push update but small modifations are needed to load new code which should be 
    done in flutter.jar artifact file

    I had planned a best possible way for code push but due to time constraints i can only start this project from november last week 
    or from december, i dont modify any engine code or framework code or any java code like 
    tinker lib does so it doesnot violate any store terms, output app is also aot so no performance regression, 
    i try to make it as easy implementation so that any one can plugin to their app, based on my research on code 
    base flutter team is intentionally made impossible to make code push i tried all the possiblities with current implementation 
    and concluded that only possible ways either you have to make engine modifications or prepare a solution without modifing engine, 
    i go for 2nd option and planned all necessary requirements for the project. 
    I hope project will suceed. In the mean time if flutter team will reasses the issue we all are happy with inbuilt implementation.

    Hi all its November already as I said i started my work it's going well. It is gona be a private project, 
    so i will charge a license key to use it. So it's not gona be free, since i don't have any source of income 
    i have to do this way, if you are interested i will create a follow up repository about work, follow that for updates. 
    Once i created the timeline repo i will inform you guys.

    If you are interested in my implementation
    follow progress report here

    please read all my comments above before proceeding.

## Possibilities You can try your self
    I thought first through tinker lib can help us make code possible, but i dont find enough good documents to do so, 
    only reference to flutter from tinker lib i found is one person tried to succeed with that, 
    but those conversation was in chineese, also tried to contact that person, 
    i didn't get any ping from him. Currently i don't implement this way because it violates playstore policies as well. 
    but if you don't care about legal policies or if you dont host your app through playstore you may try this proceedure.
